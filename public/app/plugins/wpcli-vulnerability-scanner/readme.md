## Installation

### Global command, automatically

It can be installed as a wp-cli package via git repo which is the most preferred way to install.

```
wp package install 10up/wpcli-vulnerability-scanner:dev-trunk
```

### API Access
WP-CLI Vulnerability Scanner works with [WPScan](https://wpscan.com) and [Patchstack](https://patchstack.com/) to check reported vulnerabilities; you can choose any one of these two to use. You will need to add a constant in your `wp-config.php` to decide which API service you want to use (by default **WPScan API** will be used). 

To use **WPScan API**:
```
define( 'VULN_API_PROVIDER', 'wpscan' );
```

To use **Patchstack API**:
```
define( 'VULN_API_PROVIDER', 'patchstack' );
```

You will need to register for a user account and supply an API token from the chosen API service.  Once you have acquired the token, you can add it as a constant in wp-config.php as follows:

```
define( 'VULN_API_TOKEN', 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' );
```

### Global command, manually

Clone this repo, and require `wpcli-vulnerability-scanner.php` from wp-cli config.  E.g. in `~/.wp-cli/config.yml` [[other config locations](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/references/config/#config-files)]

```
require:
  - /path/to/this/repo/wpcli-vulnerability-scanner.php
```

### Standard plugin

This repo can be installed as a regular plugin. There is no UI, but the command will become available.

```
wp plugin install --activate https://github.com/10up/wpcli-vulnerability-scanner/archive/trunk.zip
```

After plugin installation, you can verify the command is in place with `wp help vuln`

## Usage

```
wp vuln status
```

 * *Options:*
 * `--test` Load test data
 * `--format=<format>` Accepted values: table, csv, json, count, ids, yaml. Default: table
 * `--nagios` Output for nagios
 
```
wp vuln core-status
```
 
 * *Options:*
 * `--format=<format>` Accepted values: table, csv, json, count, ids, yaml. Default: table
 * `--nagios` Output for nagios

```
wp vuln plugin-status
```

 * *Options:*
 * `--test` Load test data
 * `--porcelain` Only print slugs of vulnerable plugins with updates
 * `--format=<format>` Accepted values: table, csv, json, count, ids, yaml. Default: table
 * `--nagios` Output for nagios
 
```
wp vuln theme-status
```

 * *Options:*
 * `--test` Load test data
 * `--porcelain` Only print slugs of vulnerable theme with updates
 * `--format=<format>` Accepted values: table, csv, json, count, ids, yaml. Default: table
 * `--nagios` Output for nagios

### Example usage

**Basic**

```
wp plugin update $(wp vuln plugin-status --porcelain)
```

Will simply error out if there are no slugs returned by the `plugin-status` command. Can suppress the output by appending ` &> /dev/null` 

```
wp theme update $(wp vuln theme-status --porcelain) &> /dev/null
```

**Scheduled/Cron**

```
0 0 * * * wp theme update $(wp vuln theme-status --porcelain) &> /dev/null
0 0 * * * wp plugin update $(wp vuln plugin-status --porcelain) &> /dev/null
```

`0 0 * * *` is everyday at midnight. For assistance creating an alternate schedule, check out [http://crontab.guru/](http://crontab.guru/). For example, `0 0 * * 1,4` runs at midnight every Monday and Thursday.

**With email notifications**

Included is a sample bash script, `includes/vuln.sh`. This can be customized and used in a cron job so that you can be alerted when vulnerabilities are found.

 * `WPCLIPATH` should be the full path to your wp command. The script will attempt to discover this automatically if the given filename does not exist

 * `RECIPIENT` should be an email address which will receive the notifications
 * `SUBJECT` is the email subject

This readme does not discuss configuring the `mail` command on your server. To run a simple test, try 

```
echo "This is the body text" | mail -s "Email subject" you@domain.com

```

**Nagios**

`wp vuln plugin-status --nagios` will give output for Nagios monitoring.

## Check uninstalled themes and plugins

Check a specific version of a theme or plugin. Example:

```
wp vuln theme-check twentyfifteen --version=1.1
```

Or check several at once (cannot accept versions)

```
wp vuln plugin-check wppizza wordpress-seo
```
 
## Running Tests

### Prerequisites:

 Must have environment variables for WP_CLI_BIN_DIR, WP_CLI_CONFIG_PATH and VULN_API_TOKEN

 ```
export WP_CLI_BIN_DIR='/tmp/wp-cli-phar'
export WP_CLI_CONFIG_PATH='/tmp/wp-cli-phar/config.yml'
export VULN_API_TOKEN='Your API Token Here'
```

To use **Patchstack API**:

 ```
export VULN_API_PROVIDER='patchstack'
```

### Install dependencies

```
composer install
./bin/install-package-tests.sh
```

*Note: Not uncommon for composer to run out of memory, you may need to take steps to free up memory on your end*

### Run tests

```
./vendor/bin/behat features/vuln-theme-status.feature
```

To check **Patchstack API**:

```
./vendor/bin/behat features/vuln-plugin-patchstack.feature
```
